# Strategic Ssales Forecasting
## Project Overview

SalesForecasting is a lightweight Python package for automated time-series forecasting of sales data. It streamlines data preparation, model selection, training and evaluation under a simple API.

Main Features

- Automatic ETS-based modeling• Supports additive and multiplicative seasonality• Selects trend and seasonality components intelligently
- Confidence intervals and uncertainty quantification
- Batch forecasting across multiple series (e.g., by product_id)
- Built-in evaluation (MAE, RMSE) on hold-out sets
- Customizable hyperparameters for advanced tuning
- Pandas-friendly API and DataFrame outputs

Typical Use Cases

- Retail demand planning (daily, weekly or monthly)
- E-commerce SKU-level sales projection
- Revenue forecasting and budget planning
- Inventory optimization and replenishment scheduling
- Automated reporting pipelines and dashboards

Minimal Example

Import the core Forecaster class and run a simple forecast:

```python
from salesforecasting import Forecaster
import pandas as pd

# Load historical data
df = pd.read_csv("data/historical_sales.csv", parse_dates=["date"])

# Train a 6-month ahead forecaster on monthly data
fc = Forecaster(horizon=6, frequency="M")
fc.fit(df, date_col="date", value_col="sales")

# Generate forecasts with confidence intervals
forecast_df = fc.predict()
print(forecast_df.head())

```

This snippet illustrates SalesForecasting’s end-to-end workflow: load data, fit the model, and retrieve forecasts ready for analysis or visualization.
